##JavaScript File Browser
###Interview coding assignment 

This is a simple javascript-based 'file browser' written as a coding test. The original assignment can be found in Assingment.txt. The filesystem is a dummy tree accessed via an API.

The project uses jQuery and no other libraries. 
All icon assets used are from [icons8](https://icons8.com/)

####To set up
Simply download the repo and open `fbrowse.html` in a browser.

####To-do
If this were more than a quick programing assignment, there are some things that could be added to add polish and functionality: 
- Anchor the navigation part of the header to the top of the page when the files list is long enough to cause the page to scroll
- Some sort of loading indicator for API calls in case they are slow to respond
- ARIA accessibility attributes
- More standard file manager features
